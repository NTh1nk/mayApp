I am feeling kinda stuck so here is a gameplan:



1. Get the geocaching to work

2. Make it so that coords can be translated to markers.

3. Make the algo work


V.2 

1. Get google login to work

2. Get markers to persist by login

done. Do some frontend stuff, f.ex making the omt text white when calculated
