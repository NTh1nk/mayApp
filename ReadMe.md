This is the start, of an app, which i will spend a 100 hours during May to make.

Description: it can be a mobile app, a web app, or a desktop app

This was also included as a helper: Ship a playful web or mobile app through 100 hours of coding this month (May)

Ideas:

Mobile game unity

Kalshi prediction bot, using pytorch and tensorflow. (doesnt sound very playfull).
    Could be fun, for finding patterns in things which you would imagine not nessarly being correlated.
    Seems like only US residents can use the app, therefore i can cross this one off.
    
Move abroad app,
    Stipend abroad app, helps you finds stipends like the 90 days in SF

VisaMate, helps you navigate travelling abroad.

WorkTogether
    A web app, that takes the location of each of the members in your organisation, and comes up with dates for meetings and so on, 
    This will deal with timezones and so fourth, also made for people who travel alot, and who move timezones reguarly
    With the growing number of people working remote, this will be more and more relevant
