Hey, I’m Johannes, and I built GMC — the Global Meeting Coordinator — to solve a problem that most of us face every week: scheduling meetings across time zones

[Problem ]
If you've ever tried to book a meeting with people in three or more countries, you know how frustrating it is — endless back-and-forth, time zone confusion, and no one’s ever available at the same time.

[Solution ]
GMC makes it simple. Just enter each participant’s location and availability, and it instantly calculates the optimal meeting time — and even suggests a central meeting point. It works globally, visually, and in real time.

[Closing ]
“If you're working with international teams, try GMC. It’s accurate, intuitive, and built for how modern teams actually work.
